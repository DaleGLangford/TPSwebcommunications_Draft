	<p class="aboutText"> Hello, my name is Dale Langford. I am a professional archaeologist and catogographer in training. I have over seven years experience working in commercial archaeology and during this 
		time I have had the opportunity to work on projects throughout Ontario (Canada), the United Kingdom, and the Republic of Ireland. Recently I have decided to persue my love
		of mapping in an effort to combine both of my passions. This website has been designed to provide an overview of my archaeological career and ongoing cartographic learning. Feel free to explore some of what I feel are some of the more unique
		artefacts and adventures I have had. Cheers! </p>
